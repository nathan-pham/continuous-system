# Continuous System
Continuous evolution system

## Experiment Details
1. Generations are fluid; overlapping "ants" with high enough energy will create offspring
2. Each ant has a unique genome containing speed, size, color, rate of energy consumption, and energy capacity
3. Plants regenerate in a different location after they are eaten

## Experiment Conclusions
1. Infinitely regenerating food is useless if it is inaccessible to the population.
2. Large populations consume food at a similar rate to the regenerating food, allowing for deaths.
3. Populations with higher chances of growing also have 3x more starting food
